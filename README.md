Project Title: University Admission Eligibility System

Project Summary:
The University Admission Eligibility System is a C program that assists students in determining their eligibility for admission to various universities based on their GPA. Additionally, it provides information about the university's minimum GPA requirements, admission fees, and available seats. The program also includes an administrative panel for adding universities to the system.

Key Features:
1. User Eligibility Check:
   Allows users to check their eligibility for a specific university by entering their name and GPA for SSC and HSC.

2. List of Eligible Universities:
   Provides a list of universities for which the user meets the GPA requirements.

3. Minimum GPA Requirement:
   Displays a list of universities sorted by their minimum total GPA requirements.

4. Admission Form Fee:
   Lists universities based on their admission form fees in ascending order.

5. Available Seats:
   Displays universities sorted by the number of available seats.

6. University Information Display:
   Presents a comprehensive list of all universities categorized into Science and Business Studies groups, including their names, minimum GPA requirements, admission form fees, and available seats.

7. Administrative Panel:
   Provides an administrative panel with a password authentication system.
   Allows authorized users to add new universities to the system by specifying the group (Science or Business Studies), and university details, and saving them to the respective database files.


User Interaction:
1. Users input their group choice (Science or Business Studies) and their GPA for SSC and HSC.
2. The system checks eligibility and provides information accordingly.
3. Users can choose to view a list of eligible universities, GPA requirements, admission form fees, and available seats, or display comprehensive university information.
4. An administrative panel allows authorized users to add new universities to the system.

This project aims to simplify the university admission process for students by providing information on eligibility and requirements while offering administrators a convenient way to update the system with new university data.
